// Problem statement

Many children came to a celebration.
Organise them into the minimum possible number of groups such that
the age of any two children in the same group differ by at most one year.




        minGroups(C){
            m = len(c)
            for each partition into groups
            c = g1 U g2 U g3 U g4...U gk
            good = true;
            for i from 1 to k:
                if max(gi) - min(gi) > 1:
                    good = false

                if good:
                    m = min(m,k)
         return m;
         }
 Time complexity : 2^n


// Efficient algorithm
