Tree: 

A collection of entities called nodes
linked together to simulate hierarchy

The top most node is called root of the Tree
Any node that doesnot have a child are called leaf nodes

Tree can be called recursive data structure
A tree with n nodes have n-1 edges

Depth of x = length of path from root to x
Height of x = No. of edges in longest path from x to a leaf
so, height of leaf nodes will be zero

Height of tree Height of root node

Binary tree : A tree in which each node can have 
at most 2 children.

Applications of trees:
----------------------

hierarchical data => ex : file system
organize data => for quick search, insertion, deletion => ex : binary search trees
Trie : dictionary
Network routing algorithm
