Graph:
 A graph G is an ordered pair of a set V of vertices 
 and a set E of edges
    G = (V, E)

    ordered pair: 
        (a, b) != (b, a) if a !=b
    
    unordered pair: 
        {a, b} == {b, a} 


An edge is uniquely identified by two end points
    Two types of edges: directed edge (one way) and undirected edge (two ways)
    directed edge : ordered pair
    undirected edge : unordered pair 

Two types of graphs, 

    weighted graph : define some weight over the edges, in between the connected nodes.
    unweighted graph : the weight inbetween the edges is bydefault 1.


    |v| ==> No. of vertices
    |e| ==> No. of edges

Self loop:
    An edge is called self-loop or self-edge if there is only one vertex
    Sometimes if edges are depicting some relationship or connection that's possible with 
    same node as origin and destination.

    Multi-edge: parallel edges to the same node
        | node 1 | two paralled nodes |node 2|
    
Minimum no. of edges in a graph is zero

No. of edges in a directed graph
    n * (n-1) if directed

Tree : A tree is an undirected graph with no cycles
