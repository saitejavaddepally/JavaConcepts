STACK ADT
---------

A list with the restriction that insertion and deletion can be performed only
from, one end, called the top

1. push (Insertion)
2. pop  (deletion)
3. top (returns the element at top of the stack)
4. IsEmpty() (returns true if stack is empty else false)

All of these time complexities of constant time O(1)
