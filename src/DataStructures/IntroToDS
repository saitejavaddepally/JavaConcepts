A data structure is a way to store and organize data, in
a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

1. Mathematical or Logical Models

Abstract Data Types:
define data and operations, but no implementation.

Arrays --> Concrete Implementation

 1. logical view
 2. operations
 3. cost of operation
 4. implementation



List as abstract data type
--------------------------

List -->    store a given number of elements of a given data type
            write or modify at a position
            Read elements at position
            empty if there are no elements in the list
            insert
            remove
            count
            read/modify
            specify data-types to the list


 For arrays -->

1. Access --> Read/write element at an index --> constant time --> O(1)
2. Insert --> Insert at end --> constant time --> O(1)
          --> Insert at first --> T X n ==> O(n)
          --> remove --> O(n)
          --> Add --> O(n)

 For Linked Lists -->
