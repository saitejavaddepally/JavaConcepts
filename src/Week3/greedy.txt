        This method is used for solving optimization problems

        Optimization Problems : A problem which demands minimum result or maximum
        result

        P : A --> B

        suppose we need to travel from A--> B in 12 hrs, we can't have a
        journey by walk or by bicycle, we can reach only it in car.
        It also gives us minimum cost.

        A solution that depends upon a condition is known as feasible solution,
        though there are many solutions.

        There should be only one optimal solution.

        There are three methods to solve optimization problems.

        1. Greedy method
        2. Dynamic Programming
        3. Branch and Bound


        Greedy method should be solved in stages.

        Algorithm Greedy ( a, n ) {
            for i = 1 to n {
                x = select(a);

                if feasible(x) then {
                    solution += x;
                }
            }
        }


        General Strategy of Greedy Algorithm

        problem -----Greedy choice----> Safe move
         <------------sub problem<<--------------

         1. Make a greedy choice.
         2. Prove that it is a safe move.
         3. Reduce to a sub problem
         4. Solve the sub problem
